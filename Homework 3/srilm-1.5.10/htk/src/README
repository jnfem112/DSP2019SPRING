This directory contains an interface between SRILM and the HTK lattice
tools developed at Entropic Cambridge Research Labs for the 1995 Johns
Hopkins University LM summer workshop.  It will only be of use if you
have access to the HTK libraries and lattice tool source files.  Since
to my knowledge these tools were never been distributed more widely,
chance are the code in this directory is useless to most people.

The following Makefile variables need to be changed to locate the
HTK-supplied files:

HTK_LIB_DIR
HTK_LATTICE_DIR

To use an SRILM model with HTK tools, the LM configuration files needs 
to start with "!SRILM".  Subsequent lines contain options and arguments
in the style of ngram(1).  See SRILM-config.sample for an example.
